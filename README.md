## 🧠 About me

I have been building frontend systems since 2016 — from complex admin dashboards and product interfaces to custom UI components and performance-critical tables.

I'm passionate about:
- Elegant UX in complex systems
- Frontend architecture that scales
- Thinking in systems, not just screens

Currently exploring AI-first tools and full-stack React (Next.js / Node.js / PostgreSQL).
